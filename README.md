## Vocabulary Learning

In this project, I aimed to develop a simple English Word Game. I designed the game using a Microsoft Access relational database and the C# programming language. The objective of the game is to write the Turkish equivalents of the given English words. You earn points for each word you answer correctly. If you answer incorrectly or don't know the word, you have the option to change the word, but you only have 3 chances to do so.
